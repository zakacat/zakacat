I come from a varied background (workwise), but I have a goal that I am working on actualizing. I want to be a programmer and software engineer. I am currently in my first year of engineering studies and I very glad that I came back to school. I am also a Red Seal Journeyman Iron worker, which is a bit unrelated, but the transition of work type does not scare me (maybe it is a bit intimidating) because I think I love learning new things. The first year of Engineering at my college has a very open pathway that can lead to many different disciplines, and working in construction for 7+ years, I thought that doing civil or structural engineering was a perfect fit. Even so, I found myself drawn to programming. In my first semester of CPS (using Java), we were taught some basics and my virtual world opened... but it soon felt closed agian. I was working with JavaFX on my winter break (yes, willingly). I started a course as an elective which was Introduction to Android Development and I then realized that this is a tool that I want to become proficient with. This is something that I can bring along with me, perfect, get summer work, and truly dive into the deep-end with. This is the tool with which I will enjoy proving my knowledge. I can test, run, share with friends, and research endlessly with Android. 

I would absolutely love a job that would give me the freedom to constantly challenge myself intellectually and travel the world. People may use the term digital nomad, and that may be a fair assignment, but I have been nomadic almost my entire life. I am just digitizing.

### <ins>Current Goals</ins>

- Get a part-time job with development.
- Continue education with an intent to get the best grades possible (translated as- to take away as much from the course as possible).
- Create an impressive app to hopefully become available on the App Store.
- Contribute to an open source project with like-minded people.

#### English

My grades in highschool were not good, but I always had a bit of interest in story telling and communicating. I wrote poetry often in my spare time as a teenager, and I have written some well-reviewed short stories. This subsided for some time until, when I was 26 and livving in Alberta, I chanced upon an opportunity to teach English. I took a TESOL course (with certification) and soon after I found myself in Colombia teaching English. I enjoyed it... a lot. I started to appreciate the more technical aspects of English and was brought up to date with the grammatical rules that governs it when I had to teach it to the old and young alike. 

English IS communication, and communication is how we as humans share ideas, thoughts, opinions, and information. English is the neccesary basis for documentation, and documentation is a critical tool for communicating information.

#### Work Ethic

I have worked in construction for many years and although it may seem unrelated to this current field that I want pursue, it has ingrained some priceless habits and values. I wake up early, often before dawn, and I am (almost) always at least 5 minutes early for work. I understand that a engaged, long day of work is a neccesity for the vast majority of the world, and I am no different. I try and get along with not only my peers, but my superiors as well while respecting that even though our roles within a cooperation may be different, we are all a similar species pursuing similar goals. From recovering addicts to closet genuises, and from the nepotistically entitled to the gifted-yet-ignored, I have worked alongside and managed to empathize with the lot. Not to ignore my own wellbeing, or the wellbeing of others, but some days require harder work than the rest and, depending on the context, the slow days should still be utilized for often neglected tasks like cleaning, organizing, and documenting. Safety takes a larger role in construction than most fields, but it has some important precursors such as planning, communication, and a trust of other's information and experience. Work is dynamic even when it becomes easy to get complacent, and complacency sometimes leads to mistakes but always stagnation. In any profession, I think it is important to always challenge yourself whether if be obtaining tickets or certificates or refreshing old knowledge. 

I think a person should strive for an engaging, fun, fair, productive, constantly-improving, and of course profitable workspace.
